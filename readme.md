#About Me
Hello! My name is Holly (she/her) and I am an old lady in spirit with a young person's body (ish). In my previous life, AKA before I came to UW Madison, I was a teacher for two years. I taught high school students English Language Arts. While I loved it, it definitely was difficult and burnt me out quick, so I decided to pursue librarianship on a whim. I LOVE IT! I'm a serious bibliophile with an extreme love of baking, crochet, Degrassi, and anything and everything involving Shania Twain.
